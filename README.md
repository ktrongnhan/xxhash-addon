Overview
===========
`xxhash-addon` is a native addon for Node.js (>=8.6.0) written using N-API. It 'thinly' wraps [xxhash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) `v0.8.1`, which has support for a new algorithm `XXH3` that has been showed to outperform its predecessor.

__IMPORTANT__: As of `v0.8.0`, XXH3 and XXH128 are now considered stable. Rush to the upstream [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/v0.8.0/CHANGELOG) for the formal announcement! `xxhash-addon v1.4.0` is the first iteration packed with stable XXH3 and XXH128.

Why v2?
==========
1. Greatly improved performance backed by benchmarks (see charts below.)
2. Better consistency and smaller code size thanks to pure C-style wrapping.

The following results are generated by running the benchmark.js file. `Duration (ms)` measures time taken to digest 10GB of randomly filled buffer using streaming methods (`update()` and `digest()`) of the hash functions.

```bash
npm run benchmark
```


* On an ARM MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021): M1 Pro, 16GB of Mem, macOS Monterey 12.4, Node.js v16.15.1

|Hash func |Length (bits) |Duration (ms) | Note |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
|MD5 (node:crypto) |128 |19653 ||
|SHA1 (node:crypto) |160 |4380 ||
|BLAKE2s256 (node:crypto) |256 |18293 |BLAKE2s is so slow on Node.js. This is not aligned with [xxHash benchmark](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash#benchmarks). |
|XXH64 (node-xxhash) |64 |734 |Compiled with `-O2`.|
|XXH64 (xxhash-addon) |64 |732 |Compilied with `-O2`. On ARM Mac, `xxhash-addon` wrapper of XXH64 is consistently as fast as `node-xxhash`. |
|XXH3 (xxhash-addon) |64 | 350 |Compilied with `-O2`. On ARM, XXH3 is x2 times faster than XXH64 and x50 times faster than MD5. |


* On an Intel Mac mini (2018): Core i3, 8GB of Mem, macOS Monterey 12.4, Node.js v16.15.0

|Hash func |Length (bits) |Duration (ms) | Note |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
|MD5 (node:crypto) |128 |15187 ||
|SHA1 (node:crypto) |160 |10568 ||
|BLAKE2s256 (node:crypto) |256 |27334 |BLAKE2s is so slow on Node.js. This is not aligned with [xxHash benchmark](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash#benchmarks). |
|XXH64 (node-xxhash) |64 |986 |Compiled with `-O2`.|
|XXH64 (xxhash-addon) |64 |1038 |Compilied with `-O2`. On Intel Mac, `xxhash-addon` wrapper of XXH64 is consistently slower than `node-xxhash` by ~5%. |
|XXH3 (xxhash-addon) |64 | 767 |Compilied with `-O2`. Significant improvement on XXH3. Even more impressive on ARM. |




Features
==========
* `xxhash-addon` exposes xxhash's API in a friendly way for downstream consumption (see the Example of Usage section).
* Covering all 4 variants of the algorithm: XXH32, XXH64, XXH3 64-bit, XXH3 128-bit.
* Supporting XXH3 secret.
* Consistently producing canonical (big-endian) form of hash values as per [xxhash's recommendation](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/blob/e2f4695899e831171ecd2e780078474712ea61d3/xxhash.h#L243).
* The addon is extensively sanity-checked againts xxhash's sanity test suite to ensure that generated hashes are correct and align with xxhsum's (`xxhsum` is the official utility of xxhash). Check the file `xxhash-addon.test.js` to see how `xxhash-addon` is being tested.
* Minimal dependency: the package does not depend on any other npm packages.

Installation
=========
```bash
npm install xxhash-addon
```

Note: This native addon requires recompiling. If you do not have Node.js building toolchain installed then you must install them first:

* On a Windows machine

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

* On a Debian/Ubuntu machine

```bash
sudo apt-get install python g++ make
```

* On a RHEL/CentOS machine

If you are on RHEL 6 or 7, you would need to install GCC/G++ >= 6.3 via `devtoolset-` for the module to compile. See [SCL](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/).

* On a Mac

Install `Xcode command line tools`


Development
=========

This is for people who are interested in creating a PR.

**How to clone?**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktrongnhan/xxhash-addon
git submodule update --init
npm install
npm run debug:install
npm run benchmark
npm test
```
Note: `debug:install` compiles and links with Address Sanitizer (`-fsanitze=address`). `npm test` may not work out-of-the-box on macOS.

**How to debug asan build?**

You may have troubles running tests with asan build. Here is my snippet to get it running under `lldb` on macOS.

Key takeaways:
* If you see an error saying Asan Interceptor is loaded too late, set the env `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. You need to use absolute path to your Node.js binary and jest.js as well. Curious why? [An interesting article](https://jonasdevlieghere.com/sanitizing-python-modules).

```bash
$ lldb node node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js
(lldb) env DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/13.1.6/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib
(lldb) breakpoint set -f src/addon.c -l 100
(lldb) run
(lldb) next
```

**How to upgrade xxHash?**

Everything should be set up already. Just pull from the release branch of xxHash.

```bash
git submodule update --remote
git status
git add -u
git commit -m "Bump xxHash to..."
git push origin your_name/upgrade_deps
```

In comparison to other implementations/bindings
=========
* [node-xxhash](https://github.com/mscdex/node-xxhash)

Although node-xxhash offers incredible compability as it requires Node.js >= 4.0.0, it does not seem to produce consistent hash values.
For example, given a seed value of 0xDEADBEEF and the string 'hello', node-xxhash's XXH32 produces 2717969635 as the string's hash, which is in big-endian form, whilst its XXH64 produces cd6d9204aaad5b0c, which is in little-endian form.

* [xxhashjs](https://github.com/pierrec/js-xxhash)

This fantastic project is a pure JavaScript implementation of the algorithm. However it has not been updated for years.

Example of Usage (TODO: update for v2)
=========

```javascript
// Construct a new hasher and seed it 0 (default seed value)
// Note: constructors can take either JS Number or Buffer as their argument
const { XXHash32, XXHash64, XXHash3 } = require('xxhash-addon');
const hasher32 = new XXHash32(0);
// const hasher32 = new XXHash32(); // equivalent to the previous call
// const hasher32 = new XXHash32(Buffer.alloc(4)); // equivalent to the previous call, too

// Hash a string
const salute = 'hello there';
const buf_salute = Buffer.from(salute);
console.log(hasher32.hash(buf_salute));

// Digest a byte-stream (hash a buffer piece by piece)
hasher32.update(buf_salute.slice(0, 3));
console.log(hasher32.digest());
hasher32.update(buf_salute.slice(3));
console.log(hasher32.digest());

// Reset the hasher for another hashing
hasher32.reset();

// Using secret for XXH3
// Same constructor call syntax, but hasher switches to secret mode whenever
// it gets a buffer larger than 135 bytes
const hasher3 = new XXHash3(require('fs').readFileSync('package-lock.json'));
```
